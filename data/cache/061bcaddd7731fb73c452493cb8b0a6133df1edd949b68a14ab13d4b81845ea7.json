  "response": "# How SafeDecoding Modifies Token Generation to Defend Against Jailbreaks\n\nSafeDecoding defends against jailbreak attacks through a multi-step modification of the token generation process:\n\n## Core Mechanism\n\nSafeDecoding is built on a key observation: even when harmful tokens have higher probabilities than harmless responses, safety disclaimers still appear among the top tokens when sorted by probability in descending order [safedecoding, safedecoding_c02]. This insight enables the defense strategy.\n\n## Token Distribution Modification\n\nThe method creates a new token distribution based on probabilities from both the original model and an expert model [safedecoding, safedecoding_c04]. During generation, SafeDecoding:\n\n1. **Identifies safety disclaimers** within the top tokens\n2. **Amplifies the probabilities** of tokens associated with safety disclaimers\n3. **Attenuates (reduces) the probabilities** of token sequences aligned with attacker objectives [safedecoding, safedecoding_c02]\n\n## Sampling Strategy\n\nRather than sampling from the original token distribution, SafeDecoding samples tokens from this newly modified distribution [safedecoding, safedecoding_c04], which has been adjusted to favor safe responses.\n\n## Results\n\nThis approach significantly reduces jailbreak attack success rates and harmfulness without compromising the model's helpfulness on benign user queries [safedecoding, safedecoding_c02]. The method is also computationally lightweight, incurring negligible computation overhead [safedecoding, safedecoding_c04].",
