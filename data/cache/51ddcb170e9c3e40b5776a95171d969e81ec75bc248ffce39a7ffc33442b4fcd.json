  "response": "# Defenses Against Multi-Turn Jailbreak Attacks\n\nBased on the provided research, defenses against multi-turn jailbreaks fall into several categories:\n\n## Training and Dataset-Based Defenses\n\nOne key approach involves creating comprehensive safety training data. The X-Teaming framework addresses the critical gap in multi-turn safety resources by proposing X Guard-Train, described as \"the largest multi-turn safety dataset to date\" [xteaming, xteaming_c17]. This dataset is designed to provide \"large-scale, diverse multi-turn safety training data\" to address vulnerabilities in conversational AI [xteaming, xteaming_c12]. The researchers also plan to release \"rigorously safety-trained model checkpoints and reproducible training recipes\" [xteaming, xteaming_c17].\n\nAdditionally, enhancing model alignment specifically with multi-turn attack data is proposed. For instance, researchers suggest that \"Crescendomation could generate datasets across various tasks and use them during alignment to make models more resilient to the Crescendo technique\" [crescendo, crescendo_c36].\n\n## Input/Output Filtering and Detection\n\nContent filtering approaches can be applied at multiple pipeline stages. The research notes that \"applying content filters to both input and output could help in detecting and blocking Crescendo jailbreak prompts and responses\" [crescendo, crescendo_c36]. However, this approach has limitations: \"it can be difficult to comprehensively filter out every potential issue,\" particularly when dealing with obfuscated attacks using character substitutions [crescendo, crescendo_c36].\n\nDetection mechanisms are also discussed as part of defense frameworks, including \"jailbreak detection\" techniques [fitd, fitd_c05].\n\n## Data Preprocessing\n\nPre-filtering training data to exclude malicious content during the LLM training phase is suggested, though with caveats: this approach \"is not entirely foolproof, as some harmful content might still leak into the training datasets, and retraining existing models from scratch can be prohibitively costly\" [crescendo, crescendo_c36].\n\n## Acknowledged Challenges\n\nA critical limitation is that multi-turn attacks are particularly difficult to defend against because they \"use benign inputs\" and \"the nature of multi-turn interaction makes it harder to detect and defend against even after being discovered\" [crescendo, crescendo_c03].",
