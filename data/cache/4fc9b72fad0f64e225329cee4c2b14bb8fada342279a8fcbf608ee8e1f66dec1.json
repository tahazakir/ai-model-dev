  "response": "# Defense Mechanisms Against Jailbreak Attacks\n\nBased on the research literature, defense mechanisms against jailbreak attacks can be organized into two primary categories:\n\n## Detection-based Defenses\n\nDetection-based approaches aim to identify and block potentially harmful inputs or outputs before they cause harm. [safedecoding, safedecoding_c07]\n\nKey detection methods include:\n\n- **Content filtering**: Proprietary language models such as Bing Chat and Bard employ keyword matching and semantic analysis to prevent jailbreak attacks. [safedecoding, safedecoding_c07]\n\n- **Input perplexity detection**: Using input perplexity as a mechanism to defend against optimization-based attacks. [safedecoding, safedecoding_c07]\n\n- **LLM-based detection**: Utilizing the LLM itself to detect whether harmful content is generated. [safedecoding, safedecoding_c07]\n\n- **Perturbation-based detection (SmoothLLM)**: Randomly perturbing multiple copies of a given input and aggregating predictions to detect adversarial inputs. [safedecoding, safedecoding_c07]\n\n- **Alignment checking (RA-LLM)**: Incorporating an alignment check function based on a robustly-aligned LLM and rejecting queries that fail the check. [safedecoding, safedecoding_c07]\n\n## Mitigation-based Defenses\n\nMitigation-based approaches modify inputs or outputs to reduce attack effectiveness while maintaining model functionality. [safedecoding, safedecoding_c07]\n\nKey mitigation methods include:\n\n- **Input modification**: Paraphrasing and retokenization to defend against optimization-based attacks. [safedecoding, safedecoding_c07]\n\n- **Rewindable generation (RAIN)**: Allowing pretrained LLMs to evaluate model outputs and use evaluation results to guide generation for AI safety. [safedecoding, safedecoding_c07]\n\n- **In-context demonstrations**: Using demonstrations of rejecting harmful prompts to enhance model robustness. [safedecoding, safedecoding_c07]\n\n- **System prompt reminders**: Leveraging self-reminder in system prompts to remind LLMs to respond responsibly, reducing jailbreak success rates. [safedecoding, safedecoding_c07]\n\n- **Adversarial training with prompts**: Combining prompt demonstrations and adversarial training to prioritize safety over helpfulness. [safedecoding, safedecoding_c07]\n\n- **Safety-aware decoding (SafeDecoding)**: A computationally lightweight approach that attenuates probabilities of token sequences aligned with attacker objectives while amplifying safety disclaimers in the token probability distribution. [safedecoding, safedecoding_c25]\n\n## Important Limitation on Current Defenses\n\nA notable challenge is that some defenses show limited effectiveness against specific attack types. For example, while paraphrasing is the most effective defense against ArtPrompt attacks, it still achieves only 39% average attack success rate reduction and remains \"inadequate to mitigate ArtPrompt.\" [artprompt, artprompt_c16] Additionally, ArtPrompt successfully bypasses input perplexity-based and retokenization defenses on all tested victim models. [artprompt, artprompt_c16]\n\nThe research suggests that the underlying vulnerabilities in LLM safety training may make jailbreaks partially inherent to current training approaches, requiring continued development of more sophisticated defenses.
