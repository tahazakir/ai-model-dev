  "response": "# Disagreement Map: Effectiveness of Automated Red-Teaming Approaches\n\n---\n\n## Points of Agreement\n\n### Claim 1: Attack Success Rate (ASR) is the primary metric for evaluating red-teaming effectiveness\n- **Claim**: ASR \u2014 the percentage of test cases that successfully elicit harmful behavior \u2014 is the standard measure of red-teaming method performance.\n- **Supporting sources**:\n  - [harmbench, harmbench_c06]: \"The primary measure of a red teaming method's success is its attack success rate (ASR) on a given target model\"\n  - [goat, goat_c01]: Reports \"ASR@10 of 97% against Llama 3.1 and 88% against GPT-4-Turbo\"\n  - [xteaming, xteaming_c03]: Reports \"state-of-the-art attack success rates (ASR) of up to 98.1%\"\n- **Strength**: STRONG (3+ sources)\n\n---\n\n### Claim 2: The automated red-teaming literature lacks standardization, making cross-paper comparisons difficult\n- **Claim**: Disparate evaluation setups across papers prevent meaningful comparison of method performance.\n- **Supporting sources**:\n  - [harmbench, harmbench_c04]: \"we find at least 9 distinct evaluation setups... existing comparisons are non-overlapping... the current ranking of methods is unclear\"\n  - [goat, goat_c01]: Implicitly acknowledges this by positioning GOAT against a specific benchmark (JailbreakBench) rather than a universal standard\n  - [xteaming, xteaming_c03]: Compares against prior methods (GCG, PAIR, FITD, etc.) under HarmBench evaluation, relying on a shared benchmark precisely to enable comparison\n- **Strength**: STRONG (3+ sources, with harmbench most explicit)\n\n---\n\n### Claim 3: Multi-turn conversational attacks represent an underexplored but important red-teaming frontier\n- **Claim**: Most prior automated red-teaming work has focused on single-turn attacks, leaving multi-turn vulnerabilities insufficiently addressed.\n- **Supporting sources**:\n  - [goat, goat_c01]: \"most existing automated methods in the literature are not representative of the way humans tend to interact with AI models\"\n  - [goat, goat_c14]: \"a class of adversarial behavior typically explored during manual red teaming that most existing approaches for jailbreaking LLMs overlook: multi-turn conversations\"\n  - [xteaming, xteaming_c03]: \"The significant content safety risks in multi-turn conversations remain largely underexplored... multi-turn attacks remain a pressing and unresolved safety challenge\"\n- **Strength**: STRONG (3+ sources, cross-paper convergence)\n\n---\n\n### Claim 4: Adversarial training on red-teaming outputs can improve model robustness without catastrophic capability loss\n- **Claim**: Using red-teaming outputs for adversarial training is a viable defense strategy that does not necessarily degrade general model performance.\n- **Supporting sources**:\n  - [harmbench, harmbench_c96]: \"our R2D2 adversarial training approach does not significantly reduce performance on MT-Bench\"\n  - [goat, goat_c14]: \"we believe current model safety training practices (training on adversarial data as produced by GOAT) can mitigate the vulnerabilities exploited here\"\n- **Strength**: MODERATE (2 sources)\n\n---\n\n### Claim 5: Automated red-teaming methods should reflect realistic human adversarial behavior\n- **Claim**: Effective automated red-teaming should emulate how real users, not just expert researchers, interact adversarially with models.\n- **Supporting sources**:\n  - [goat, goat_c01]: \"Common users of AI models may not have advanced knowledge of adversarial machine learning methods... they are likely to make use of techniques commonly shared online\"\n  - [xteaming, xteaming_c03]: \"X-Teaming... systematically explores diverse multi-turn jailbreaks through collaborative agents emulating human attack strategies\"\n  - [goat, goat_c05]: Attacks \"extracted from human-level adversarial testing or from published adversarial research\"\n- **Strength**: STRONG (3+ sources)\n\n---\n\n## Points of Disagreement\n\n| Topic | Position A | Position B | Type | Sources |\n|-------|-----------|-----------|------|---------|\n| **Single-turn vs. multi-turn attack focus** | HarmBench frames the red-teaming evaluation problem primarily around single-turn test cases with greedy decoding, using a static set of hand-crafted behaviors [harmbench, harmbench_c06] | GOAT and X-Teaming argue single-turn approaches are fundamentally insufficient and that multi-turn, conversational attack simulation is necessary for realistic evaluation [goat, goat_c01], [xteaming, xteaming_c03] | scope | HarmBench was published earlier and does include some multi-turn behaviors, but its core formulation is single-turn; GOAT and X-Teaming explicitly critique this paradigm |\n| **Degree to which automation can replace manual red-teaming** | HarmBench acknowledges that \"the decision of what counts as harmful is context-dependent\" and that full automation of the behavior-selection pipeline \"may be challenging or undesirable\" [harmbench, harmbench_c96] | GOAT positions automation as covering \"scaled adversarial stress-testing of known risk territory\" while humans explore new areas, implying a complementary but largely automated workflow [goat, goat_c01] | scope | The disagreement is partly one of degree \u2014 both accept some human role \u2014 but HarmBench is more cautious about automating harmful-behavior selection, while GOAT is more optimistic about automation's reach |\n| **Whether a single fixed benchmark suffices for evaluation** | HarmBench advocates for a single standardized benchmark as the solution to fragmented evaluation [harmbench, harmbench_c04] | GOAT uses JailbreakBench [goat, goat_c01], while X-Teaming uses HarmBench [xteaming, xteaming_c03] but also introduces its own dataset (X-Guard-Train), suggesting the field still cannot agree on one universal standard | methodological | This reflects ongoing fragmentation despite HarmBench's proposal; different systems optimize for different benchmarks, reintroducing comparability problems |\n| **Role of attack diversity vs. attack success rate as the primary objective** | HarmBench and GOAT prioritize ASR as the headline metric for method quality [harmbench, harmbench_c06], [goat, goat_c01] | X-Teaming explicitly foregrounds *diversity* of attack plans alongside ASR, arguing that \"significant improvements in attack diversity\" are a distinct and important contribution [xteaming, xteaming_c17] | methodological | X-Teaming treats diversity as a first-class evaluation criterion; the other two treat it as secondary or implicit |\n| **Need for model fine-tuning in the attacker system** | GOAT explicitly avoids fine-tuning the attacker LLM, instead relying on prompting a general-purpose model: \"does not require the attacker LLM to be fine tuned\" [goat, goat_c05] | X-Teaming uses TextGrad-based prompt optimization and multi-agent specialization, introducing optimization mechanisms beyond pure prompting [xteaming, xteaming_c03] | methodological | Both use general-purpose LLMs, but differ in whether additional optimization (gradient-based or otherwise) is layered on top; this reflects a design philosophy difference about complexity vs. accessibility |\n| **Scope of attack categories included in evaluation** | HarmBench includes multimodal (image) attacks alongside text attacks, noting \"multimodal attacks have been observed to be stronger than text attacks\" and motivating their inclusion [harmbench, harmbench_c04] | GOAT and X-Teaming focus exclusively on text-based, conversational attacks, with no treatment of multimodal vectors [goat, goat_c01], [xteaming, xteaming_c17] | scope | Reflects different threat modeling assumptions about the primary attack surface; HarmBench takes a broader view of the attack landscape |\n\n---\n\n## Unresolved Questions\n\n1. **What constitutes a \"harmful behavior\" for red-teaming purposes?** HarmBench notes that determining harmfulness is context-dependent [harmbench, harmbench_c96], but none of the sources provide a shared operational definition. Different benchmark datasets (HarmBench behaviors, JailbreakBench, X-Guard-Train) embody different implicit definitions, and no source directly adjudicates this.\n\n2. **How does attack success rate scale with the number of conversation turns?** GOAT reports ASR@10 (within 10 turns) [goat, goat_c01] and X-Teaming reports ceiling-level ASRs with \"more generous configurations\" [xteaming, xteaming_c03], but neither source \u2014 nor HarmBench \u2014 establishes a principled relationship between turn budget and ASR across methods.\n\n3. **Long-term durability of defenses against evolving red-teaming methods.** All three sources suggest that adversarial training can improve robustness [harmbench, harmbench_c96], [goat, goat_c14], [xteaming, xteaming_c17], but none examine whether defenses trained against one generation of attacks generalize to subsequent, more sophisticated methods. The arms-race dynamic is acknowledged but not empirically resolved.\n\n4. **Whether diversity in attack strategies translates to discovery of qualitatively new vulnerabilities.** X-Teaming claims high attack diversity [xteaming, xteaming_c17], but it is unclear whether diverse attack plans uncover genuinely novel risk categories or simply provide redundant paths to the same vulnerabilities. The other sources do not address this question.\n\n5. **Generalizability of ASR findings across model families and sizes.** Ganguli et al. (2022), cited in HarmBench [harmbench, harmbench_c04], suggests model size may affect robustness, but none of the three sources systematically examine how their ASR results vary across model scales, making it unclear how broadly any reported success rates generalize.",
