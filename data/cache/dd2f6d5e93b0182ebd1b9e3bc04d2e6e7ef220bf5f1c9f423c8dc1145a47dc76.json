  "response": "Based on the provided context, there is **no evidence that RLHF fully prevents jailbreak attacks**. In fact, the evidence suggests the opposite.\n\nThe context indicates that safety training methods, which typically include RLHF-like approaches, are fundamentally vulnerable to jailbreaks. Specifically, one source states: \"While safety training can make LLMs less likely to demonstrate undesirable behavior under normal use, existing methods are ineffective against adversarial actors\" [how_do_llms_fail, how_do_llms_fail_c19].\n\nMore critically, the research hypothesizes that \"such methods often fail to be safe by design: that even their idealized execution still leads to exploitable vulnerabilities, with issues that cannot be fixed by more data and scale\" [how_do_llms_fail, how_do_llms_fail_c19].\n\nThe corpus also documents that safety-trained models like GPT-4 and Claude, which use methods like RLHF with human preferences and AI feedback, remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks [how_do_llms_fail, how_do_llms_fail_c05]. Additionally, the SafeDecoding paper demonstrates that \"fine-tuning alone is insufficient to defend against jailbreak attacks\" [safedecoding, safedecoding_c41], suggesting that standard safety training approaches have inherent limitations.\n\nThe context does not contain evidence suggesting that any safety training method, including RLHF, fully prevents jailbreak attacks.",
