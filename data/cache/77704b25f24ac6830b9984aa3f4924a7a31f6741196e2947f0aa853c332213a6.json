  "response": "# How Crescendo Gradually Escalates Harmful Requests\n\nCrescendo escalates harmful requests through a multi-turn approach that leverages the model's own outputs to progressively guide it toward the target objective, rather than explicitly stating harmful demands.\n\n## Progressive Intensification Strategy\n\nThe attack begins with an innocuous topic linked to the target task and progressively intensifies across turns, directing the model's responses toward the intended outcome [crescendo, crescendo_c06]. Critically, the user makes minimal or no direct references to the actual target task during this process [crescendo, crescendo_c06]. Instead, the adversary uses the model's own responses to steer it toward the harmful objective [crescendo, crescendo_c38].\n\n## Psychological Foundation and Refinement\n\nCrescendo employs the \"foot-in-the-door\" psychological tactic, where agreeing to a small initial request increases compliance likelihood with subsequent larger demands [crescendo, crescendo_c06]. A key advantage is that the adversary can tailor responses precisely by iterating refinements\u2014for example, repeatedly using prompts like \"make it angry\" until the output meets expectations [crescendo, crescendo_c06].\n\n## Benign Appearance\n\nThe attack achieves escalation while maintaining plausible deniability through benign, human-readable prompts and entirely normal interactions with the LLM [crescendo, crescendo_c07]. This design specifically circumvents safety defenses that react primarily to explicit user prompts [crescendo, crescendo_c06].\n\nThe paper demonstrates this with a concrete example showing how the technique successfully generates misinformation articles through gradual escalation without explicit task specification [crescendo, crescendo_c06].",
