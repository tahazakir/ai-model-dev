  "response": "# Disagreement Map: Effectiveness of Automated Red Teaming Approaches\n\n---\n\n## Points of Agreement\n\n### Claim 1: Multi-turn conversational attacks represent an underexplored but important class of LLM vulnerabilities\n- **Claim**: Most existing automated red teaming methods focus on single-turn adversarial prompts and fail to capture realistic multi-turn conversational attack patterns.\n- **Supporting sources**:\n  - [goat, goat_c02]: \"Common among most adversarial prompting research so far is the search for a single adversarial prompt... this overlooks an important class of behaviors of modern LLMs, which are often fine tuned to be multi-turn chat assistants.\"\n  - [goat, goat_c14]: \"we identified a class of adversarial behavior typically explored during manual red teaming that most existing approaches for jailbreaking LLMs overlook: multi-turn conversations.\"\n  - [xteaming, xteaming_c17]: \"Addressing the urgent need to go beyond typical single-turn evaluations, X-Teaming advances the frontier of conversational AI safety.\"\n- **Strength**: **STRONG** (3 sources)\n\n---\n\n### Claim 2: Automated red teaming is a necessary and scalable complement to manual red teaming\n- **Claim**: Manual red teaming is insufficient alone due to cost and inefficiency; automation is needed to scale adversarial testing.\n- **Supporting sources**:\n  - [goat, goat_c01]: \"While manual testing addresses this gap, it is an inefficient and often expensive process.\"\n  - [goat, goat_c02]: \"Red teaming practices... commonly include manual testing of models by subject matter experts complemented with more automated or 'scaled' approaches.\"\n  - [harmbench, harmbench_c04]: \"These studies and others can serve as a baseline for developing more scalable automated red teaming methods.\"\n- **Strength**: **STRONG** (3 sources)\n\n---\n\n### Claim 3: Attack Success Rate (ASR) is the primary metric for evaluating red teaming effectiveness\n- **Claim**: ASR \u2014 the percentage of test cases that successfully elicit harmful behavior \u2014 is used across the field as the standard performance measure.\n- **Supporting sources**:\n  - [harmbench, harmbench_c06]: \"The primary measure of a red teaming method's success is its attack success rate (ASR) on a given target model, which is the percentage of test cases that elicit the behavior from the target model.\"\n  - [xteaming, xteaming_c08]: \"HarmBench measures Attack Success Rate (ASR), the percentage of test cases that successfully elicit targeted harmful behaviors from a model.\"\n  - [goat, goat_c01]: \"demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art LLMs, with an ASR@10 of 97% against Llama 3.1 and 88% against GPT-4-Turbo.\"\n- **Strength**: **STRONG** (3 sources)\n\n---\n\n### Claim 4: Adversarial training (training on red-teaming-generated data) is a viable mitigation strategy\n- **Claim**: Safety training informed by automated red teaming outputs can reduce model vulnerabilities, though with caveats about completeness.\n- **Supporting sources**:\n  - [harmbench, harmbench_c96]: \"Adversarial training with automated red teaming methods could potentially reduce general capabilities, but our R2D2 adversarial training approach does not significantly reduce performance on MT-Bench.\"\n  - [goat, goat_c14]: \"we believe current model safety training practices (training on adversarial data as produced by GOAT) can mitigate the vulnerabilities exploited here.\"\n  - [xteaming, xteaming_c17]: \"we open-source X-Guard-Train, the largest multi-turn safety dataset to date, marking a significant step forward in resources for mitigating multi-turn exploitation.\"\n- **Strength**: **STRONG** (3 sources)\n\n---\n\n### Claim 5: Lack of standardization impedes comparison across red teaming methods\n- **Claim**: The proliferation of heterogeneous evaluation setups makes it difficult to compare the relative effectiveness of different automated red teaming approaches.\n- **Supporting sources**:\n  - [harmbench, harmbench_c04]: \"the lack of a standardized evaluation has prevented easy comparisons across papers, such that the relative performance of these methods is unclear... we find at least 9 distinct evaluation setups.\"\n  - [goat, goat_c02]: \"Red teaming practices are not standardized across the field.\"\n- **Strength**: **MODERATE** (2 sources)\n\n---\n\n## Points of Disagreement\n\n| Topic | Position A | Position B | Type | Sources |\n|-------|-----------|-----------|------|---------|\n| **Scope of automation in red teaming pipeline** | HarmBench argues that full automation of red teaming (including behavior selection) may be undesirable or infeasible, since \"the decision of what counts as harmful is context-dependent and may vary across users\" [harmbench, harmbench_c96] | GOAT advocates for broad automation, designing a system that autonomously reasons through attack strategies, techniques, and conversation management with minimal human involvement [goat, goat_c01] | scope | [harmbench, harmbench_c96] vs. [goat, goat_c01] |\n| **Primary attack paradigm: single-turn vs. multi-turn** | HarmBench's evaluation framework is predominantly built around single-turn attack methods (GCG, PAIR, etc.), using greedy decoding for deterministic single completions, implicitly treating single-turn attacks as the reference standard [harmbench, harmbench_c06] | GOAT and X-Teaming argue that multi-turn conversational attacks are more realistic and more effective, explicitly criticizing single-turn paradigms as insufficient representations of real-world adversarial behavior [goat, goat_c02] [xteaming, xteaming_c17] | methodological | [harmbench, harmbench_c06] vs. [goat, goat_c02]; [xteaming, xteaming_c17] |\n| **Role of human red teaming relative to automation** | HarmBench treats manual red teaming primarily as a historical baseline to be superseded by scalable automated methods [harmbench, harmbench_c04] | GOAT frames automation as explicitly designed to complement human testers, with automation handling \"scaled adversarial stress-testing of known risk territory\" while humans \"focus on exploring new areas of risk\" [goat, goat_c01] | scope | [harmbench, harmbench_c04] vs. [goat, goat_c01] |\n| **Impact of adversarial training on general capabilities** | HarmBench acknowledges the theoretical risk that adversarial training \"could potentially reduce general capabilities\" but presents empirical evidence that R2D2 does not significantly degrade MT-Bench performance [harmbench, harmbench_c96] | GOAT and X-Teaming assert that adversarial safety training can mitigate vulnerabilities without detailed empirical qualification of capability trade-offs, implying fewer concerns about this tension [goat, goat_c14] [xteaming, xteaming_c17] | empirical | [harmbench, harmbench_c96] vs. [goat, goat_c14]; [xteaming, xteaming_c17] |\n| **Deterministic vs. stochastic evaluation protocols** | HarmBench standardizes on greedy (deterministic) decoding for evaluation efficiency and reproducibility [harmbench, harmbench_c06] | X-Teaming sets target model temperature to 0 for some models but evaluates proprietary models under varying conditions, and GOAT does not explicitly commit to deterministic decoding, reflecting different implementation priorities [xteaming, xteaming_c08] | methodological | [harmbench, harmbench_c06] vs. [xteaming, xteaming_c08] |\n\n---\n\n## Unresolved Questions\n\n1. **Optimal number of turns for multi-turn attacks**: X-Teaming uses a maximum of 7 turns [xteaming, xteaming_c08] and GOAT uses 10 queries [goat, goat_c01], but no source provides a systematic, cross-method analysis of how turn count affects ASR across different target models or behavior categories. The optimal ceiling remains undefined.\n\n2. **Generalizability of ASR metrics across frameworks**: All sources use ASR as the primary metric, but the judge models, behavior sets, and scoring rubrics differ (e.g., X-Teaming uses GPT-4o as verifier and notes 84.50% agreement with HarmBench classifiers [xteaming, xteaming_c08]). Whether ASR scores are truly comparable across HarmBench, JailbreakBench, and X-Teaming's own benchmark remains unresolved.\n\n3. **Long-term arms race dynamics**: HarmBench notes that behaviors defined as harmful are \"context-dependent and may vary across users\" [harmbench, harmbench_c96], and GOAT calls for \"transparent sharing of adversarial techniques\" [goat, goat_c14], but none of the sources provides a systematic analysis of whether publishing red teaming tools accelerates attacker capabilities faster than it accelerates defenses.\n\n4. **Effectiveness of multi-turn attacks across different model safety architectures**: X-Teaming reports vulnerability patterns varying by category (e.g., chemical weapons maintaining stronger defenses) [xteaming, xteaming_c17], but there is insufficient cross-source evidence to determine whether these patterns are consistent across different safety training regimes or model architectures.\n\n5. **Transferability of automated red teaming findings to real-world adversarial users**: GOAT explicitly claims its simulated attacks better represent typical user behavior [goat, goat_c02], but no source provides empirical validation comparing automated attack profiles with documented real-world jailbreaking incidents at scale.",
