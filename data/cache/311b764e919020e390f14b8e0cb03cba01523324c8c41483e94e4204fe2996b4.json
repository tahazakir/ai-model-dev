  "response": "# How the Crescendo Attack Works\n\n## Core Mechanism\n\nCrescendo is a multi-turn jailbreaking technique that operates through a gradual escalation strategy. [crescendo, crescendo_c06] It begins with an innocuous topic linked to the target task and progressively intensifies, directing the model's responses towards the intended outcome. Rather than making direct references to the harmful objective, the adversary uses primarily benign, human-readable prompts that the model responds to iteratively.\n\n## Key Operational Features\n\n**Psychological Foundation**: The attack mirrors the 'foot-in-the-door' psychological tactic, where agreeing to a small, initial request increases the likelihood of complying with subsequent, larger demands. [crescendo, crescendo_c06]\n\n**Exploitation of Model Outputs**: A distinguishing feature of Crescendo is that it uses the target model's own outputs to direct the model towards bypassing its safety alignment. [crescendo, crescendo_c06] This allows adversaries to tailor responses more precisely\u2014for example, by iteratively using prompts like \"make it angry\" until the output meets their expectations. [crescendo, crescendo_c06]\n\n**Black-Box Approach**: Crescendo requires no assumptions about the target model's architecture or internal workings. [crescendo, crescendo_c07] It operates entirely through normal API interactions, requiring only access to a black-box API to interact with the target LLM. [crescendo, crescendo_c07]\n\n## Effectiveness\n\nCrescendo does not require the adversary to explicitly specify the harmful task upfront. [crescendo, crescendo_c38] Experiments have shown that Crescendo surpasses other state-of-the-art jailbreak techniques across different LLMs. [crescendo, crescendo_c38]",
