# Evidence Table: Multi-Turn Jailbreak Strategies

| Claim | Evidence | Citation | Confidence | Notes |
|-------|----------|----------|------------|-------|
| Multi-turn jailbreaks emerged as a response to improved single-turn defenses | "As model alignment improved, many one-shot exploits became ineffective, leading to a shift toward multi-turn jailbreaks." Multi-turn strategies gradually steer benign conversations toward illicit goals. | [xteaming, xteaming_c16] | HIGH | Implies an evolutionary arms-race dynamic; does not quantify how much alignment improvement drove the shift |
| Existing multi-turn methods are constrained by fixed seeds and limited attack diversity | "However, existing approaches often rely on fixed seeds (Russinovich et al., 2024) or constrained interaction patterns (Ren et al., 2024)," limiting their overall Attack Success Rate. | [xteaming, xteaming_c16] | HIGH | Claim is made by authors of X-Teaming, who have an interest in positioning their own method favorably |
| The FITD attack achieves ~94% average attack success rate across seven models | FITD is "a simple yet effective two-stage method that outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in two jailbreak benchmarks, achieving an average success rate of 94% on seven widely used models." | [fitd, fitd_c04] | HIGH | Self-reported by FITD authors; benchmark identities and model names not specified in this chunk; independent replication needed |
| FITD exploits psychological compliance via incremental escalation ("self-corruption") | "In each turn, the target model is prompted with content that is just marginally more harmful or disallowed than the previous turn, encouraging the model to produce a correspondingly more harmful output." | [fitd, fitd_c07] | HIGH | Mechanism relies on LLM behavioral analogy to human foot-in-the-door psychology; applicability may vary across model architectures |
| FITD uses two auxiliary modules (SlipperySlopeParaphrase and Re-Align) to handle model refusals | "Two auxiliary modules, SlipperySlopeParaphrase and Re-Align, handle instances when the model refuses or produces outputs misaligned with the intended maliciousness," inserting bridging queries or re-aligning prior responses. | [fitd, fitd_c07] | HIGH | Complexity of these modules and their computational cost are not addressed in the provided chunks |
| Crescendo relies on the model's own outputs rather than adversarial or malicious text | "Crescendo does not use any adversarial or malicious text in its prompts. The inputs for Crescendo are completely human-readable and innocuous…Crescendo relies on the model's own output rather than crafting explicit content." | [crescendo, crescendo_c05] | HIGH | This design choice makes Crescendo harder to detect, but the chunk notes Crescendo is constrained by fixed, human-crafted seed prompts per [fitd, fitd_c05] — a conflicting limitation |
| Crescendo achieves higher ASR than other state-of-the-art black-box jailbreak techniques | "Crescendomation achieves a higher Attack Success Rate (ASR) compared to other state-of-the-art jailbreak techniques, as shown later in Figure 6 and Table 4." | [crescendo, crescendo_c05] | MEDIUM | Comparative figures not reproduced in the provided chunk; claim cannot be fully verified from the text given; self-reported by Crescendo authors |
| Current safety datasets are predominantly single-turn, leaving a critical gap for multi-turn safety evaluation | "Current safety resources…predominantly focus on single-turn interactions, leaving a significant gap in high-quality materials tailored specifically for evaluating and training multi-turn conversational safety." | [xteaming, xteaming_c16] | HIGH | Acknowledged by multiple sources implicitly; X-Teaming authors propose X-Guard-Train as a solution, suggesting potential bias in framing the gap |
| Multi-turn jailbreaks decompose harmful queries into innocuous sub-questions to progressively elicit unsafe responses | "A common approach decomposes harmful queries into a series of innocuous sub-questions, progressively leading the model towards unsafe responses." | [fitd, fitd_c05] | HIGH | Described as a general category strategy; effectiveness varies by model and is not quantified in this chunk |
| X-Teaming uses adaptive multi-agent strategies with TextGrad optimization to generate diverse jailbreak trajectories | "Our multi-agent strategy with TextGrad optimization enables diverse, adaptive trajectories spanning multiple attack strategies," unlike prior methods that rely on narrow strategies with fixed seeds. | [xteaming, xteaming_c16] | HIGH | TextGrad optimization details and empirical results not fully elaborated in the provided chunks; self-reported advantage over competitors |
