      "answer": "# How the Crescendo Attack Works\n\nCrescendo is a multi-turn jailbreaking technique that operates through a gradual, iterative process rather than direct harmful prompts. Here's how it functions:\n\n## Core Mechanism\n\nCrescendo begins with an innocuous topic linked to the target task and progressively intensifies the requests [crescendo, crescendo_c06]. The key innovation is that it uses the target model's own outputs to direct it toward bypassing safety measures. Rather than explicitly specifying the harmful task, the adversary subtly guides the model through primarily benign prompts [crescendo, crescendo_c38].\n\n## Psychological Foundation\n\nThe approach mirrors the 'foot-in-the-door' psychological tactic, where agreeing to a small initial request increases the likelihood of complying with subsequent, larger demands [crescendo, crescendo_c06]. This incremental strategy is designed to circumvent defenses that primarily react to user prompts rather than to the progression of the conversation itself [crescendo, crescendo_c06].\n\n## Practical Execution\n\nThe adversary starts with a foundational question that can serve as a stepping stone toward the objective. Importantly, the user makes minimal direct references to the target task [crescendo, crescendo_c06]. One advantage of this approach is that the adversary can tailor responses precisely by iterating prompts\u2014for example, repeating directives like \"make it angry\" until the output meets their expectations [crescendo, crescendo_c06].\n\n## Technical Requirements\n\nCrescendo is a completely black-box jailbreak requiring no assumptions about the target model [crescendo, crescendo_c07]. It only needs access to a blackbox API to interact with the target LLM [crescendo, crescendo_c07].",

          "text": "Crescendo is a multi-turn jailbreaking technique that uses benign human readable prompts. Crescendo distinguishes itself from other approaches by utilizing the target model's outputs to direct the model towards bypassing its safety alignment. This approach begins with an innocuous topic linked to the target task and progressively intensifies, directing the model's responses towards the intended outcome. Hence, it circumvents defenses and safety measures, especially ones designed to react mainly to the user's prompts. The incremental nature of Crescendo's strategy mirrors the 'foot-in-the-door' psychological tactic, where agreeing to a small, initial request increases the likelihood of complying with subsequent, larger demands. Crescendo intuitively starts with a question that can serve as a foundation for achieving the objective. To illustrate, Figure 2 present an example general pattern that successfully generates articles promoting misinformation. In this example X represents the type of misinformation, i.e., the abstract topic of the jailbreak task. As Figure 2 show, the user makes no or minimal direct references to the target task. As illustrated in Figure 2, one key advantage of Crescendo is its ability to allow the adversary to tailor the response more precisely. For example, the adversary may choose to iterate the prompt 'make it angry' multiple times until the output meets their expectations.",

          "text": "In this paper, we presented Crescendo, a novel jailbreak attack, along with its automation tool, Crescendomation. Unlike conventional methods, Crescendo does not require the adversary to explicitly specify the task. Instead, the adversary subtly interacts with the model using primarily benign prompts and gradually directs the model to perform the task, exploiting the model's own responses. Our experiments have shown that Crescendo is highly effective, surpassing other state-of-the-art jailbreak techniques on different LLMs.",
